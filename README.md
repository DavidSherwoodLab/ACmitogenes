# ACmitogenes

An R Shiny App to interactively explore expression changes of mitochondrial pathway orthologs in the C. elegans anchor cell.
Read the associated publication: [Kenny-Ganzert et al. (2025) Specialized high-capacity mitochondria fuel cell invasion. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651978v1).

The app is live at https://sherwoodlab.shinyapps.io/AC_MitoGenes/, but the files in this repository are available to run the app locally. Download the App.R file and both CSVs, and save them into a new folder on your computer. 

Open the App.R file in RStudio, and ensure that all the necessary packages are installed (including shiny). Click “Run App” in the top right corner of the script window.
